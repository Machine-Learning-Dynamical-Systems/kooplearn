# Learn Koopman and Transfer operators for Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Processes

`kooplearn` is a Python library designed for learning Koopman or Transfer operators associated with dynamical systems. Given a _nonlinear_ dynamical system $x_{t + 1} = S(x_{t})$, the **Koopman operator** provides a _global linearization_ of the dynamics by mapping it to a suitable space of observables $\mathcal{F}$. An observable is any (scalar) function of the state. The Koopman operator $\mathsf{K}$ is defined as $$(\mathsf{K}f)(x_{t}) = f(x_{t + 1}) := f \circ S (x_t) \qquad f \in \mathcal{F}.$$
Similarly, given a stochastic process $X:= \{ X_{s} \colon s \in \mathbb{N}\}$, its **Transfer operator* returns the expected value of any observable forward in time. The Transfer operator $\mathsf{T}$ is defined as $$(\mathsf{T}f)(x) := \mathbb{E}\left[f(X_{t + 1}) \mid X_{t} = x \right] \qquad f \in \mathcal{F}.$$

`kooplearn` provides a suite of algorithms for model training and analysis, enabling users to perform forecasting, spectral decomposition, and modal decomposition based on the learned operator.

Please note that `kooplearn` is currently under active development, and while we are continuously adding new features and improvements, some parts of the library might still be a work in progress.

## Features

- Implement different algorithms to learn Koopman or transfer operators for dynamical systems.
- Perform forecasting using the learned operators.
- Conduct spectral decomposition of the learned operator.
- Perform modal decomposition for further analysis.
